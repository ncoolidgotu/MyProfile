Website is hosted on my local server and proxied via CloudFlare

*Ignore the error for https://nate.coolidge.ml/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection in the link checker. This is because I use a cloudflare proxy to host the site and I believe this is some backend link that gets thrown in every one of my websites. This link is not found anywhere in my actual website.
